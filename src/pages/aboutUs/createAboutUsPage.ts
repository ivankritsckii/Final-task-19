  To optimize the development process, a discussion channel was created in which all members of the group participated in the discussion of the project implementation process. 
  The entire project was divided into 4 sprints, each of the sprints in turn was divided into smaller tasks.
  Before the start of each sprint, a team meeting was held to discuss the order of task completion and the distribution of roles in the team. 
  The results of the discussion were recorded on the Trello task board.
  During the project, the team members fully demonstrated their strengths in development. 
  Each team member was ready to help their teammates. We consider RShop a successful project!! The project was completed as part of training on the RSShool platform`;
